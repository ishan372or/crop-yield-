CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION-USING-ML
The model focuses on predicting the crop yield in advance by analysing factors like soil pH,nitrogen,phosphorus,potassium,moisture content,rainfall,humidity,sunlight exposure and historical crop yield using 
various supervised machine learning techniques .This helps to know the crop yield in advance and choose the ideal conditions for maximum yield.
